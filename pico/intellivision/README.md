# fuji-intv-bring-up-lab

This repo contains RP2040 code used for the bring-up of the Intellivision FujiNet using a PiRTO II cart.

There are two goals:

(1) Emulate a ROM properly on the CP-1610 bus.
(2) Communicate a command frame to FujiNet, and back.

This firmware will be supplanted by the real thing, soon enough. But for now, it's here so others can jump in and help.
