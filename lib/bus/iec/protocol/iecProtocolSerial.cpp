// STEP 3: SENDING THE BITS
// The talker has eight bits to send.  They will go out without handshake; in other words,
// the listener had better be there to catch them, since the talker won't wait to hear from the listener.  At this
// point, the talker controls both lines, Clock and Data.  At the beginning of the sequence, it is holding the
// Clock true, while the Data line is RELEASED to false.  the Data line will change soon, since we'll sendthe data
// over it. The eights bits will go out from the character one at a time, with the least significant bit going first.
// For example, if the character is the ASCII question mark, which is  written  in  binary  as  00011111,  the  ones
// will  go out  first,  followed  by  the  zeros.  Now,  for  each bit, we set the Data line true or false according
// to whether the bit is one or zero.  As soon as that'sset, the Clock line is RELEASED to false, signalling "data ready."
// The talker will typically have a bit in  place  and  be  signalling  ready  in  70  microseconds  or  less.  Once
// the  talker  has  signalled  "data ready," it will hold the two lines steady for at least 20 microseconds timing needs
// to be increased to 60  microseconds  if  the  Commodore  64  is  listening,  since  the  64's  video  chip  may
// interrupt  the processor for 42 microseconds at a time, and without the extra wait the 64 might completely miss a
// bit. The listener plays a passive role here; it sends nothing, and just watches.  As soon as it sees the Clock line
// false, it grabs the bit from the Data line and puts it away.  It then waits for the clock line to go true, in order
// to prepare for the next bit. When the talker figures the data has been held for a sufficient  length  of  time,  it
// pulls  the  Clock  line true  and  releases  the  Data  line  to  false.    Then  it starts to prepare the next bit.
